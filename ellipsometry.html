<h1>Ellipsometry</h1>

<h2>What is Ellipsometry?</h2>
<p>
Ellipsometry is an optical characterization technique that measures changes in the
polarization state of light upon reflection from a material surface.
Its high sensitivity originates from the precise determination of the relative
phase change between polarized light components.
</p>

<h2>Why Is Ellipsometry So Powerful?</h2>
<p>
The sensitivity of ellipsometry arises from measuring the relative phase difference
between the reflected polarization components rather than absolute intensity.
</p>

<h2>What Is Measured?</h2>

<p>
Ellipsometry measures the complex ellipsometric ratio:
</p>

$$
\rho = \frac{r_p}{r_s} = \tan(\Psi)e^{i\Delta}
$$

<p>
Here, $r_p$ and $r_s$ are the complex Fresnel reflection coefficients for p- and
s-polarized light. The experimentally measured quantities are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\Psi$ — amplitude ratio</li>
  <li>$\Delta$ — phase difference</li>
</ul>

<div class="box">
The ellipsometric ratio $\rho$ is a complex quantity containing both amplitude
and phase information, which makes ellipsometry extremely sensitive to thin films
and interfaces.
</div>

<h2>What Parameters Can Be Determined?</h2>

<p>
The ellipsometric ratio $\rho$ is related to the Fresnel equations, allowing the
extraction of a wide range of optical and material properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optical constants ($n$, $k$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$)</li>
  <li>Thin film thickness</li>
  <li>Surface and interfacial roughness</li>
  <li>Alloy composition</li>
  <li>Crystallinity</li>
  <li>Optical anisotropy</li>
  <li>Depth profiles</li>
  <li>Growth rates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mathematical Theory</h2>

<p>
For a non-conducting, non-dispersive medium, Maxwell’s equations lead to the
electromagnetic wave equation. A plane-wave solution can be written as:
</p>

$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)}
$$

<p>
where the complex refractive index is defined as:
</p>

$$
\tilde{n} = n + ik
$$

<h2>Jones Vectors and Jones Matrices</h2>

<p>
In the absence of space charges ($\rho = 0$) and assuming an isotropic material,
the electric field components lie in the plane perpendicular to the propagation
direction. The field can be expressed using s- and p-polarization components:
</p>

$$
\mathbf{E} =
\begin{bmatrix}
E_p \\
E_s
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<p>
This two-component representation is known as the Jones vector.
Optical elements are described using 2×2 Jones matrices:
</p>

$$
\mathbf{E}_{out} = J \mathbf{E}_{in}
$$

<p>
The diagonal elements describe changes in amplitude and phase of the s and p
components, while the off-diagonal elements represent coupling between them.
</p>

<h2>Polarization States</h2>

<h3>Linear Polarization</h3>
<p>
In linear polarization, the s and p components have the same phase:
</p>

$$
\Delta = 0
$$

<h3>Circular Polarization</h3>
<p>
In circular polarization, the components have equal magnitude and a phase
difference of $\pm \pi/2$:
</p>

$$
|E_p| = |E_s|,\quad \Delta = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

<h3>Elliptical Polarization</h3>
<p>
In elliptical polarization, the components have unequal magnitudes and a nonzero
phase difference:
</p>

$$
|E_p| \neq |E_s|,\quad \Delta \neq 0
$$

<h2>Definition of $\Psi$ and $\Delta$</h2>

$$
\tan(\Psi) = \left|\frac{r_p}{r_s}\right|,\quad
\Delta = \arg(r_p) - \arg(r_s)
$$

<p>
Once $\rho$ is measured, optical properties can be extracted by fitting Fresnel
models to the experimental data.
</p>

<h2>Optical Ellipsometry Setup</h2>

<p>
In rotating analyzer ellipsometry:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unpolarized light passes through a rotating polarizer</li>
  <li>The beam reflects from the sample</li>
  <li>A rotating analyzer modulates the reflected signal</li>
  <li>Lock-in detection extracts $\Psi$ and $\Delta$</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Ellipsometry provides complete information about thin films and interfaces through
precise polarization measurements combined with Fresnel-based modeling.
